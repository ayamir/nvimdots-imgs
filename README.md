This is just an assets repo for [`ayamir/nvimdots`](https://github.com/ayamir/nvimdots), mainly used to store images, screenshots and other media for documentation or sharing. If you've landed here by accident, chances are you were looking for the actual configuration. In that case, you probably want to head over to [`ayamir/nvimdots`](https://github.com/ayamir/nvimdots) instead.

But hey, since you're already here...

## 👐 Wanna add your own?

If you're using `nvimdots` and feel like sharing your own setup (or flexing your rice!), you're more than welcome to:

- Open a [PR](https://github.com/ayamir/nvimdots-imgs/pulls) with your screenshots
- Report any broken or outdated images via the [Issues](https://github.com/ayamir/nvimdots-imgs/issues) tab

Be kind to future-you (and us): name things clearly and maybe compress those 4K ultra-HD screenshots a bit!
